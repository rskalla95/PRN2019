            </ul>
        </p>

            In developing the PRN assessments, both reliability and validity were top priorities while also keeping the questionnaire length short and manageable for clients.
            These questionnaires are designed to be used in a clinical setting and allow the therapist to see their clients' scores in comparison to the clinical cut-off and the population norm.
